# EEVEEinUPBGE

Proposal for a game engine transition before interactive mode.

https://lists.blender.org/pipermail/bf-committers/2017-December/048939.html

The code is free and open source, and has the same license as Blender (https://www.blender.org/about/license/)

Note: This project will remain as experimental and there won't be any "official" release build of this project
on my side.

CREDITS:

- The rendering code is done by Blender Foundation (Many thanks to Blender developers who
are doing an amazing work on Blender 2.8).
- The Game engine code is from UPBGE sources. Many thanks to Tristan Porteries, the main UPBGE developer,
and all UPBGE contributors.
- BGE has been coded during many years by Blender Foundation and many contributors. Many thanks to them.
