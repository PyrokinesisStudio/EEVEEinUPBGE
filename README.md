# EEVEEinUPBGE

Proposal for a game engine transition before interactive mode.

https://lists.blender.org/pipermail/bf-committers/2017-December/048939.html

The code is free and open source, and has the same license as Blender (https://www.blender.org/about/license/)

Note: This project will remain as experimental and there won't be any "official" release build of this project
on my side.
